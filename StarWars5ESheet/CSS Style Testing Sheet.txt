#### Telekinetic Wave
_8th-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Telekinetic Burst
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You manipulate the Force in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 force damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this power.

A creature blinded by this power makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 9th level, the damage increases by 2d6.

### Encounters with Beasts
Genereating encounters with beasts is usually a very simple CR calculation. Most beast types offer more than one CR option, depending on the age of the beast your players encounter.

Every planet has its own unique wildlife. While certain beasts are native to a single planet (like the rancor is native to Dathomir), others have remarkably similar cousins (like the Wampa). Additionally, some planets might have some obscure native beast that isn't replicated here. If you want to have such an encounter, either reskin a currently existing statblock appropriately or try generating your own. 

> If you generate your own monsters, please share! The 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/zYcPYTu) is a great community with over 100 members that communally works on brewing and reviewing content, and I basically live on it.

<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Species</div>

# Chapter 2: Species
A visit to any of the great cities in the worlds of Star Wars overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants. 

And the people themselves-people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues-represent many different species, from diminutive Bothans and stalwart Cereans to majestic Twi'Leks and towering Wookiees, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.

Scattered among the members of these more common species are the true exotics: a hulking Besalisk here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly Chiss there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of Jawas chatters as one of them activates a clever mechanical toy that moves of its own accord. Zabraks and Devaronians live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone Duros-a fugitive from the the Galactic Republic, trying to make his way in a world.

### Choosing a Species
Humans are the most common people in the worlds of Star Wars, but they live and work alongside Ithorians, Kiffar, Mirialan, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.

Not every intelligent species of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. The most common species vary from planet to planet and system to system. Try to choose species that make sense in your adventuring party and locale. 

Your choice of species affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a Bothan could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a Wookiee makes a tough berserker, and a Twi'lek can be a master of the Force.

\columnbreak

Your character species not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each species's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that species, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and special alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their species.

It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

### Special Traits
The description of each species includes special traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

#### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your Sith follows the light side, for example, in defiance of the Sith Empire can help you better define your character.

\pagebreakNum

#### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons and heavy shields, as explained in chapter 6.

#### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

#### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each species typically speaks, or at least understands, Galactic Basic as well as having a unique language of their own.

### Biology and Appearance
Ardennians are sentient humanoid simians hailing from the tropical paradise of Ardennia. They are covered in fur from head to their wrists and ankles, with brown and grey being the most common fur colors. Ardennians sport four arms and prehensile feet. All six of their limbs are equally dexterous.

### Society and Culture
The Ardennian people themselves are a friendly communal species that are well known for welcoming visitors and inviting newcomers to traditional feasts and dances on the sandy beaches of Ardennia. Rural Ardiennan’s live in modern tree-villages in the thick, dim jungle canopy on the majority of the islands. Ground level accommodations are available for off-world visitors even in the smaller villages. Most off-worlders stay in the large modern resort complexes which boast having miles of private beaches or in the modern cities. Several large cities exist, scattered around the world, which typically encompass an entire island or a series of smaller islands joined together.

Ardennia’s distance from the main hyperlanes makes it one of the lesser-known vacation destinations, but it's a popular one for those who don’t mind the extra travel time. Some affluent visitors prefer the solitude that Ardennia offers, and occasionally end up purchasing one of the smaller islands to build their own home. Ardennia is notable for having the most beach per square meter in the galaxy. 

### Names
Ardennian’s names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables, with a familal surname.

**Male Names.** Rio, Jakar, Hul, Lup, Quil, Jerno

**Female Names.** Rac, Bras, Nuc, Kua, Karta, Sanya

**Surnames.** Durant, Betal, Rambuan, Jabut, Karon, Pind

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

> #### Sociocultural Characteristics

> |:--|:--|:--|
> |***Homeworld***|  |Ando|
> |***Language***|  |Aqualish|

### Biology and Appearance
An amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the Aqualish people have two facial tusks which curve down over their mouths; a trait which added to their appearance as arachnids. These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.

While Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.

### Society and Culture
The Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else. Because of this, the species are considered pariahs on Ando, which has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy itself. All Aqualish speak mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. Quarrelsome and thug-like, the Aqualish culture revolved around aggression and toughness, with diplomacy being one of their weakest attributes.

### Names
Aqualish names are intended to sound strong. Surnames are not familial, but are chosen by each individual Aqualish.

**Male Names.** Bung, Gu, Opege, Soni, Tubop

**Female Names.** Cestirki, Duni, Iftu, Sifre, Umi

**Surnames.** Dogomurra, Julo, Kronem, Nidoal, Utix

***Age.*** Aqualish reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Aqualish' aggressive personalities cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Aqualish stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Arms Dealers.*** Whenever you make an Charisma (Persuasion) check related to buying or selling weapons, you are considered proficient in the Persuasion skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Aqualish. Aqualish is a harsh, guttural language. It's rare that other species bother to learn it unless they regularly interact with Aqualish.

### Droid Companion
Also at 3rd level, you gain the aid of a droid companion, either through construction or purchase. If you choose to construct your droid companion, you must have astrotech's tools, you must spend half the cost of the droid in materials, and you must spend a number of days equal to the droid's cost divided by 100. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days.

Choose a droid companion, which is detailed at the end of this discipline. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can expend 500 credits worth of materials and circuitry to interface your wristpad with that droid. It then becomes a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.

If your droid is irreparable destroyed, or you want to interface with a different droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one droid companion at a time.

Your droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:
- The droid obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your droid acts on its own.
- Your droid's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your droid companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your droid’s abilities also improve. Your droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your droid can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
